# Module-12-Self-Prompt
It is time to BUILD YOUR OWN PROMPT!! It is an exciting day when you finally have enough tools in your toolbox to start building code that does something for you! I want you to come up with your own goal for the code that you're creating. What should it do? What data will it work with? Will it be interactive? Consider the following requirements:

Must at least read or write to a file
Must utilize at least a list or dictionary
Must incorporate user input
Must utilize functions to make code organized and efficient
Must utilize at least ifs or loops
